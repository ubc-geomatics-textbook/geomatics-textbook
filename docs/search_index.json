Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity, 1933 Making beautiful maps, or making effective maps, is comparable to being able to tell a good story. Just like a good story, a beautiful map comprises certain elements that, put together, frame the narrative in a way that makes it easy for others to understand and interpret. In this way, a map is a communication device. It conveys information through a visual representation of the spatial relationships of the features for a specific area. To better understand maps as particular form of visual communication, it may be helpful to think about what it is that maps actually do. Maps represent areas larger than we can see, usually from above, and some depict phenomena that cannot be seen (Manson and Matson 2017), such as growing seasons. They also illustrate spatial relationships, such as this map showing the percentage of the population aged 65 and over by census tract in Moncton, New Brunswick. We can deduce that those aged 65 years and over are concentrated in certain areas of the city, using census tracts as a proxy. Maps illustrate how variables are related in space.

Cartography is the art and science of designing maps and consists of certain principles and rules that help ensure accuracy and clarity. All maps are simplified representations of a place and reflect the particular choices and motivations of the cartographer. Cartography is as much about deciding what to omit from a map as it choosing what to include. Making beautiful maps involves the art, and science, of selecting and modifying data and portraying concepts with clarity and precision. Decisions around colour, font size, graphical hierarchies, classification themes, and legends are all elements of maps that determine how effective, and accurate, they are in conveying information. In this chapter, you will learn about what elements go into making an effective map, the different categories of maps, and the principles of map design. Learning Objectives Identify elements of cartographic design Describe different types of maps Describe different types of symbology and classification and their uses Key Terms Map elements, symbology, classification, cartography, north arrow, scale, thematic, choropleth, dot density, reference, isoline 1.1 Types of Maps There are many different types of maps. Just try doing a Google search, and you will come across descriptions of thematic, cadastral, topographic, and physiographic maps, to name but a few. There is no standard agreement on how many different categories of maps exist. Although some differentiate among as many as five types of maps based on the functions they serve (ICSM 2021), all maps can also be categorized into just two types, reference and thematic. Reference maps represent the human-made or natural features of the landscape and are sometimes thought of as basemaps. They provide information about a particular location, such as in the example below, depicting the longest rivers in the location of Canada and where they overlap with the United States. Topographic maps based on the National Topographic System (NTS) are another example of reference maps. One example of a reference map. Longest Rivers of Canada (c) Shannon1, CC BY-SA. 1.1.1 Thematic Maps Thematic maps depict the spatial distribution of particular features, which are symbolized according to the quantitative or qualitative values of their attributes. Thematic maps, as the name implies, emphasize a particular theme, using qualitative or quantitative data. Whereas reference maps show the locations of things, such as the locations of mountains, a thematic map might represent the geology of those mountains. Qualitative thematic maps illustrate the spatial extent of categorical data (Anderson 2020), such as the 1956 map bedrock geology map below. A thematic map using qualitative categorical data. Bedrock geology (c) Comtois and Nicholson, CC BY-NC-SA 3.0. Quantitative thematic maps depict the spatial patterns of numerical data, often expressed as rates or percentages, as in the map below showing the difference in population change between two periods, where the difference is expressed as a percentage. A thematic map depicting population data as a percentage. Difference in population change (c) Statistics Canada, Open Government License - Canada. 1.1.2 Choropleth Maps There are many different types of thematic types. A commonly used thematic map is a choropleth map, which applies different colours or shading to the entire extent of a predefined aereal unit (Weiss et al. 2008). Data used in choropleth maps must be standardized and represented as rates or ratios rather than raw counts or numbers. One of the reasons choropleth maps are so widely used is because much of the data with which were concerned, such as demographic data, is tied to aereal units like census tracts or counties. The map below represents, using percentages instead of absolute numbers, the spatial distribution of the percentage of Cantonese speakers per total population in each census tract in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. Household population of mother tongue language speakers by census tract is an example of demographic data collected by Statistics Canada and can serve as a proxy for linguistic diversity. This map shows greater concentration of Cantonese speakers in census tracts in the East Vancouver area. Figure 1.1: A choropleth map representing the percentage of Cantonese speakers per total population of census tracts in the City of Vancouver Household Population by Mother Tongueretrieved from SimplyAnalytics. This map is also a good example of the potential problems with choropleth maps, which has to do with something called the Modifiable areal unit problem, or MAUP. This results when data such as population, which is the measurement of population per unit area, is aggregated into an areal unit, where the shape and scale of the unit affects the resulting rates, or values, of the data. In this map example, the areal unit is a census tract, which vary by size and population density across the city and are delineated according to factors other than number of mother tongue language speakers. Without knowing anything about census tracts, we may assume based on this map that an entire census tract contains a disproportionate percentage of Cantoneses speakers, when in reality it may be just a few households more than the census tract next to it. This map fails to convey that kind of nuance and illustrates one of the weaknesses of choropleth maps, in spite of their wide use and applicability, particularly when displaying census data. 1.1.3 Dot Density Maps In contrast to choropleth maps, raw data/counts (e.g. number of mother tongue language speakers) as well as rates/ratios (e.g. number of mother tongue language speakers per square kilometer) can be used in dot density maps. These maps use a one-to-one density, where one dot represents one count, or a one-to-many density, where one dot represents a number of counts to map the spatial distribution of a certain phenomenon. In the map below, one dot represents 20 speakers, and rather than mapping one language community, we can view the spatial distribution of two language communities to better understand different settlement patterns between two groups of Chinese speakers. Also unlike choropleth maps, dot density maps do not need to be tied to enumeration units, although they can be, such as in this map example, which uses another method of mapping the same data that was used in the choropleth map above. For their part, dots are distributed randomly, and a potential misleading aspect of dot density maps is the false interpretation that the dots are placed in precise locations in space.

There is no one way to compose a map, but a good cartographer will arrange and design map elements to provide the greatest clarity. Many maps not only include the phenomenon or object being mapped, called the figure, but also the spatial context of the figure, representing where it is in relation to the space around it, called the ground. Maps often have a frame, which bounds the figure and any other map elements within a predetermined length and width. Some frames are visible to the map reader, while others are not and simply act as a bounding box for the cartographer while designing the map. 1.2.1 Figure 09-figure.jpg from row 32 of OER Content Sharing 1.2.2 Ground use 09-figure.jpg 1.2.3 Frame use 09-figure.jpg 1.3 Elements of Maps Whereas the figure is the most prominent element of a map, most maps also contain additional elements that provide important supplementary information, without which the purpose of the map would be less clear. Thinking back to the dot density example from the previous section, it would be difficult to understand what the map was about without a title and a legend, which contained labeling and symbols explaining the units in the map. Other elements are important for spatial orientation, such as the scale and north arrow, which provide distance and directional information, particularly critical for navigational maps such as a park trail map. Just as in writing, it is also important to provide information about the data sources used in creating the map. Not only does this credit the authors of the data, it also provides transparency and the ability to assess the reliability of the data. 1.3.1 Text 10-text.svg from row 43 of OER Content Sharing 1.3.2 Legend can use 09-figure.jpg 1.3.3 Scale and North Arrow 11-scale.jpg from row 21 of OER Content Sharing image is great example of both scale and scale bars, not of north arrow 1.3.4 Measured Grid 1.3.5 Citation 1.4 Symbolization 1.4.1 Separable 1.4.2 Integral 1.4.3 Graduated 1.4.4 Configurable 1.4.5 Proportional 1.4.6 Line Weight 1.5 Colour 1.5.1 Hue 1.5.2 Chroma 1.5.3 Lightness 1.5.4 Bivariate Colour Schemes 1.5.5 Colour Pickers 1.6 Classification Schemes 1.6.1 Qualitative 1.6.2 Sequential 1.6.3 Intervals 1.6.4 Quantiles 1.6.5 Natural Breaks (Jenna) 1.6.6 Standard Deviation 1.7 Generalizations 1.7.1 Select 1.7.2 Amalgamate 1.7.3 Exaggerate 1.7.4 Displace 1.7.5 Refine 1.7.6 Simplify 1.7.7 Aggregate 1.7.8 Typify 1.7.9 Smooth 1.7.10 Enhance 1.7.11 Collapse 1.7.12 Merge 1.8 Map Design 1.8.1 Subject 1.8.2 Projection and Orientation 1.8.3 Hierarchy hierarchy.png from row 44 of OER Content Sharing for labeling hierarchy see Visual Hierarchy for discussion of and examples of visual hierachy instead 1.8.4 Balance Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
