	abstract = {Spatial and temporal changes in land cover have direct impacts on the hydrological cycle and stream quality. Techniques for accurately and efficiently mapping these changes are evolving quickly, and it is important to evaluate how useful these techniques are to address the environmental impact of land cover on riparian buffer areas. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the classes and distribution of land cover in the riparian areas of streams; (2) examine the discrepancies within the existing land cover data from National Land Cover Database (NLCD) using high-resolution imagery of the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and a LiDAR canopy height model; and (3) develop a technique using LiDAR data to help characterize riparian buffers over large spatial extents. One-meter canopy height models were constructed in a high-throughput computing environment. The machine learning algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained to perform supervised land cover classification at a 1-m resolution on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using NAIP imagery and LiDAR-derived canopy height models. This integrated approach to land cover classification provided a substantial improvement in the resolution and accuracy of classifications with F1 Score of each land cover classification ranging from 64.88 to 95.32\%. The resulting 1-m land cover map is a highly detailed representation of land cover in the study area. Forests (evergreen and deciduous) and wetlands are by far the dominant land cover classes in riparian zones of the Lower Savannah River Basin, followed by cultivated crops and pasture/hay. Stress from urbanization in the riparian zones appears to be localized. This study demonstrates a method to create accurate high-resolution riparian buffer maps which can be used to improve water management and provide future prospects for improving buffer zones monitoring to assess stream health.},

	abstract = {Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a reliable source of accurate information for forest stand inventory attributes including height, cover, basal area, and volume. The commonly applied area-based approach (ABA) allows the derivation of wall-to-wall geospatial coverages representing each of the modeled attributes at a grid-cell level, with spatial resolutions typically between 20 and 30 m. The ABA predictive models are developed using stratified inventory data from field plots, the requirement for which can increase the overall cost of the ALS-based inventory. Parsimonious use of ground plots is a key means to control variable costs in the operational implementation of the ABA. In this paper, we demonstrate how the prediction accuracy of Lorey's height (HL, m), quadratic mean diameter (QMD, cm), and gross volume (V, m3) vary when existing ABA models are transferred to different areas or are applied to point cloud data with different characteristics than those on which the original model was developed. Specifically, we consider three scenarios of model transferability: (i) same point cloud characteristics, different areas; (ii) different point cloud characteristics, same areas; and (iii) different point cloud characteristics, different areas. We generated area-based models using three modeling approaches: linear regression (OLS), random forests (RF), and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) imputation. Results indicated that the prediction accuracy of area-based models varied by attribute and by modeling approach. We found that when the models were transferred their prediction accuracy decreased, with an average increase in relative bias up to 22.04\%, and increase in relative RMSE up to 29.31\%. Prediction accuracies for HL were higher than those of QMD or V when models were transferred, and had the lowest average increase in relative bias and relative RMSE of {\textless}5\% in the majority of cases. Likewise OLS models for HL had greater prediction accuracies when models were transferred compared to RF and kNN models, especially when the point cloud characteristics were similar. Conversely, we found that for QMD and V, RF models were found to be the most transferable in cases when models were applied to different areas with similar and different point cloud characteristics. While there is potential for cost savings by transferring models and reducing data acquisition costs, our results show the degree of transferability depends more on the attribute being modelled or the modeling approach applied, and less on the characteristics of the point cloud data.},

	abstract = {Single photon lidar (SPL) is an innovative technology for rapid forest structure and terrain characterization over large areas. Here, we evaluate data from an SPL instrument - the High Resolution Quantum Lidar System (HRQLS) that was used to map the entirety of Garrett County in Maryland, USA (1700 km 2). We develop novel approaches to filter solar noise to enable the derivation of forest canopy structure and ground elevation from SPL point clouds. SPL attributes are compared with field measurements and an existing leaf-off, low-point density discrete return lidar dataset as a means of validation. We find that canopy and ground characteristics from SPL are similar to discrete return lidar despite differences in wavelength and acquisition periods but the higher point density of the SPL data provides more structural detail. Our experience suggests that automated noise removal may be challenging, particularly over high albedo surfaces and rigorous instrument calibration is required to reduce ground measurement biases to accepted mapping standards. Nonetheless, its efficiency of data collection, and its ability to produce fine-scale, three-dimensional structure over large areas quickly strongly suggests that SPL should be considered as an efficient and potentially cost-effective alternative to existing lidar systems for large area mapping.},

	abstract = {Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) systems usually operate at a monochromatic wavelength measuring the range and the strength of the reflected energy (intensity) from objects. Recently, multispectral LiDAR sensors, which acquire data at different wavelengths, have emerged. This allows for recording of a diversity of spectral reflectance from objects. In this context, we aim to investigate the use of multispectral LiDAR data in land cover classification using two different techniques. The first is image-based classification, where intensity and height images are created from LiDAR points and then a maximum likelihood classifier is applied. The second is point-based classification, where ground filtering and Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs) computation are conducted. A dataset of an urban area located in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, is classified into four classes: buildings, trees, roads and grass. An overall accuracy of up to 89.9\% and 92.7\% is achieved from image classification and 3D point classification, respectively. A radiometric correction model is also applied to the intensity data in order to remove the attenuation due to the system distortion and terrain height variation. The classification process is then repeated, and the results demonstrate that there are no significant improvements achieved in the overall accuracy.},

	abstract = {Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a remote sensing technology known for its applicability in natural resources management. By quantifying the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and underlying terrain using laser technology, ALS has been used extensively for enhancing geospatial knowledge in the fields of forestry and ecology. Structural descriptions of vegetation provide a means of estimating a range of ecologically pertinent attributes, such as height, volume, and above-ground biomass. The efficient processing of large, often technically complex datasets requires dedicated algorithms and software. The continued promise of ALS as a tool for improving ecological understanding is often dependent on user-created tools, methods, and approaches. Due to the proliferation of ALS among academic, governmental, and private-sector communities, paired with requirements to address a growing demand for open and accessible data, the ALS community is recognising the importance of free and open-source software (FOSS) and the importance of user-defined workflows. Herein, we describe the philosophy behind the development of the lidR package. Implemented in the R environment with a C/C++ backend, lidR is free, open-source and cross-platform software created to enable simple and creative processing workflows for forestry and ecology communities using ALS data. We review current algorithms used by the research community, and in doing so raise awareness of current successes and challenges associated with parameterisation and common implementation approaches. Through a detailed description of the package, we address the key considerations and the design philosophy that enables users to implement user-defined tools. We also discuss algorithm choices that make the package representative of the ‘state-of-the-art' and we highlight some internal limitations through examples of processing time discrepancies. We conclude that the development of applications like lidR are of fundamental importance for developing transparent, flexible and open ALS tools to ensure not only reproducible workflows, but also to offer researchers the creative space required for the progress and development of the discipline.},

	abstract = {Functioning lasers were first demonstrated in 1960 in the United States and in 1961 in Canada and in the Soviet Union, but research into the use of lasers as forest measurement tools did not begin for another 15 years. Initially, with respect to Earth resources, lasers were employed to measure sea ice surface roughness, to make near-shore bathymetric measurements, to penetrate forests to make detailed topographic measurements, and to fluoresce oceanic phytoplankton for surface current studies. Some of these early studies noted that forest profiles were evident but in fact added noise to topographic retrievals. As early as 1964, researchers noted vegetation returns acquired using an airborne helium-neon (He-Ne), 0.63 μm, continuous wave (CW) laser. A decade and many airborne studies later, scientists with TRANARG, a mapping and surveying company in Caracas, Venezuela, reported on flights undertaken in 1976 that utilized a He-Ne lidar to collect over 11000 km of lidar profiles, spaced 1.5 km apart, to construct a topographic map to help site a new reservoir. Though they depended on the laser to penetrate vegetation, they noted 35-40 m median canopy heights with emergents up to 55 m in their profiles. Trees came to be regarded as a signal rather than noise in the mid-1970s. In 1976 in the Soviet Union, Russian researchers felled a birch and a spruce, aimed a He-Ne CW laser with a spot size of approximately 25 mm at the horizontal trees, produced a profilograph, compared it with tape measurements, and concluded that, with increased power, such a laser could be mounted on an aircraft to remotely measure forest canopies. In 1979, they mounted their He-Ne laser on an AN-2 biplane and acquired their first airborne profiles. These studies and others done prior to 1985, i.e., the first two decades of airborne laser research, are reviewed in this glance backwards at the history of forestry lidar. © 2013 CASI.},

	abstract = {A best practice guide brings together state-of-the-art approaches, methods, and data to provide non-experts more detailed information about complex topics. With this guide, our goal is to inform and enable readers interested in using airborne laser scanning (ALS; also referred to as Light Detection and Ranging [LiDAR]) data to characterize, in an operational inventory context, large forest areas in a cost-effective manner. To meet this goal, we outline an approach to using ALS data that is based on (1) theoretical and technical applicability; (2) published or established heritage; (3) parsimoniousness; and (4) clarity. The best practices presented herein are based on more than 25 years of scientific research on the application of ALS data in forest inventory. We describe the process required to generate forest inventory attributes from ALS data from start to finish, recommending best practices for each stage, from ground sampling and statistics, through to sophisticated spatial data processing and analysis. As the collection of ground plot data for model calibration and validation is a critical component of the recommended approach, we have placed appropriate emphasis on this section of the guide. Although many readers will not have the capacity—or need—to undertake all of the stages of this process themselves, we feel it is important for all readers to have some understanding of the various stages of the process. Such an understanding is necessary to make informed decisions when determining whether ALS is an appropriate data choice for a forest management area. Moreover, a minimum level of knowledge is useful when outsourcing or establishing collaborations for data acquisition, processing, or analysis, and when evaluating deliverables. To this end, we also provide some background information on ALS.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. Forests are a major component of the global carbon cycle, and accurate estimation of forest carbon stocks and fluxes is important in the context of anthropogenic global change. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data sets are increasingly recognized as outstanding data sources for high-fidelity mapping of carbon stocks at regional scales. 2. We develop a tree-centric approach to carbon mapping, based on identifying individual tree crowns (ITCs) and species fromairborne remote sensing data, fromwhich individual tree carbon stocks are calculated.We iden- tify ITCs from the laser scanning point cloud using a region-growing algorithmand identifying species fromair- borne hyperspectral data bymachine learning. For each detected tree, we predict stem diameter fromits height and crown-width estimate. From that point on, we use well-established approaches developed for field-based inventories: above-ground biomasses of trees are estimated using published allometries and summedwithin plots to estimate carbon density. 3. We show this approach is highly reliable: tests in the ItalianAlpsdemonstratedaclose relationshipbetween field- and ALS-based estimates of carbon stocks (r2 =0?98). Small trees are invisible from the air, and a correc- tion factor is required to accommodate this effect. 4. An advantage of the tree-centric approach over existing area-based methods is that it can produce maps at any scale and is fundamentally based on field-based inventorymethods,making it intuitive and transparent. Air- borne laser scanning, hyperspectral sensing and computational power are all advancing rapidly, making it increasingly feasible to use ITC approaches for effectivemapping of forest carbon density also inside wider car- bonmapping programs likeREDD++.

	abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) data is increasingly being used for ecosystem monitoring across geographic scales. This work concentrates on delineating individual trees in topographically-complex, mixed conifer forest across the California's Sierra Nevada. We delineated individual trees using vector data and a 3D lidar point cloud segmentation algorithm, and using raster data with an object-based image analysis (OBIA) of a canopy height model (CHM). The two approaches are compared to each other and to ground reference data. We used high density (9 pulses/m2), discreet lidar data and WorldView-2 imagery to delineate individual trees, and to classify them by species or species types. We also identified a new method to correct artifacts in a high-resolution CHM. Our main focus was to determine the difference between the two types of approaches and to identify the one that produces more realistic results. We compared the delineations via tree detection, tree heights, and the shape of the generated polygons. The tree height agreement was high between the two approaches and the ground data (r2: 0.93–0.96). Tree detection rates increased for more dominant trees (8–100 percent). The two approaches delineated tree boundaries that differed in shape: the lidar-approach produced fewer, more complex, and larger polygons that more closely resembled real forest structure.},

	abstract = {The mean tree height, dominant height, mean diameter, stem number, basal area, and timber volume of 144 georeferenced field sample plots were estimated from various canopy height and canopy density metrics derived by means of a small-footprint laser scanner over young and mature forest stands using regression analysis. The sample plots were distributed systematically throughout a 1000-ha study area, and the size of each plot was 200 m2. On the average, the distance between transmitted laser pulses was 0.9 m on the ground. The plots were divided into three strata according to age class and site quality. The stratum-specific regressions explained 82-95\%, 74-93\%, 39-78\%, 50-68\%, 69-89\%, and 80-93\% of the variability in ground-truth mean height, dominant height, mean diameter, stem number, basal area, and volume, respectively. A proposed practical two-stage procedure for prediction of corresponding characteristics of entire forest stands was tested. Sixty-one stands within the study area, with an average size of 1.6 ha each, were divided into 200 m2regular grid cells. The six examined characteristics were predicted for each grid cell from the corresponding laser data utilizing the estimated regression equations. Average values for each stand was computed. Most stand level predictions were unbiased (P {\textgreater} .05). Standard deviations of the differences between predicted and ground-truth values of mean height, dominant height, mean diameter, stem number, basal area, and volume were 0.61-1.17 m, 0.70-1.33 m, 1.37-1.61cm, 16.9-22.2\% (128-400 ha-1), 8.6-11-11.7\% (2.33-2.54 m2ha-1), and 11.4-14.2\% (18.3-31.9 m3ha-1), respectively. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.
