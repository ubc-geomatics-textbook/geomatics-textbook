# Fundamentals of remote sensing {#fundamentals-of-remote-sensing}

At some point in your life you may have wondered why the sky is blue.
You may have noticed that two leaves on the same tree are slightly
different shades of green. It would be perfectly natural to wonder these
things and simply allow the questions to remain unanswered. After all,
they likely carry minimal significance compared to the other queries of
your life. What if, however, these questions could not only be answered,
but also lead you to profound insights relating to your environment?
What if differences in leaf color indicated an early summer drought or
the initial stages of a pest outbreak that would wreak havoc on the
economy? *Remote sensing* is the overarching term that refers any
scientific exploration that seeks to address these, and many other
questions.

## What is remote sensing?

Simply put, remote sensing is any method of gathering information about
an object, or objects, without physical contact. Over the course of
human history, a variety of remote sensing techniques have been used. In
fact, one could argue that any organism capable of observing
electromagnetic radiation has a built in optical remote sensing system,
such as human vision. Similar arguments could be made for other senses,
such as smell or hearing, but this chapter will focus strictly on
techniques that capture and record electromagnetic radiation.

The first recorded use of optical remote sensing occurred \_\_\_\_
(Plato). Over the next few centuries a variety of photosensitive
chemicals were discovered and, in \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_ established the
technique recognized as photography. The ability to record specific
objects within a scene proved enabled the preservation of information in
a rapid and accessible medium. Eventually, photography became a
prominent means of immortalizing everything from individual humans to
exotic landscapes. After all, a picture says a thousand words.

In 1851, an enthusiastic Frenchman named Gaspard Tournachon mounted a
camera on a hot air balloon and captured images of the earth below him.
These images were taken as the camera looked straight down, or nadir, at
the City of \_\_\_ and provided a novel view of the city. For the first
time it was possible to examine the distribution of buildings, fields,
forests and roads across the landscape. With this, airborne remote
sensing was born. Remote sensing technologies continued to advance
throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, with major socio-political
conflicts like World War I and II acting as crucibles for innovation.
The advancement of remote sensing has continued into the 21st century
and is unlikely to slow down in the future. This is due to the relevance
of three key aspects.

First and foremost, remote sensing enables the observation of objects
in, or from, locations that are otherwise inaccessible for humans. The
observation of Mars' surface from an orbiting satellite is a one current
example. A second aspect that makes remote sensing so useful is the
collection of information over a large area. For example, airborne
remote sensing technologies enable observations of land cover across
Canada (Figure \@ref(fig:11-hermosilla-canada-landcover)). The baility
ot evaluate inaccessible objects or large areas over time is a tird
avluable aspect of remote sensing and is particularly relevant for lnd
amnagement, as predictions can be informed through the observation of
hstoric patterns and processes. This is especially true for projects
aiming to restore degraded ecosystems or plan sustainable land use
practices. Before exploring the designs of specific sensor or their
applications, however, it is essential to grasp some key components that
underpin remote sensing science.

## Types of Energy

### Introduction

Stepping back from remote sensing for a moment, there are three general
types of energy commonly used to remotely observe objects: sonic,
thermal and electromagnetic. Sonic, or sound, energy is commonly used in
environments where heat or light are inconsistent or hard to measure.
Sonar is as example of a sonic remote sensing technique and is often
deployed to observe objects in liquid. Thermal, or heat, energy is used
in a variety of cases when changes in temperature indicate an underlying
physiological process. An environmental example would be the observation
of plant health via leaf temperature. Although both sonic and thermal
energies provide useful information across a variety of disciplines,
they are not the most common.

Electromagnetic radiation (EMR), which is what the human sense of sight
observes, is a popular energy source in remote sensing science. At it's
most basic, this method of observation is based on the measurement of
photons. Research using EMR is fundamentally interested in examining the
interactions of EMR, or photons, and other particles. Before diving into
the applications of EMR remote sensing (photography, spectroscopy, etc.)
it is important to understand some basic theory regarding the
measurement of photons.

Essentially, photons are the smallest physical property in the
electromagnetic field. Photons can be emitted from objects engaged in
nuclear processes (such as the sun), objects excited thermally (like a
light bulb) or objects that reflect or emit absorbed radiation. The
interactions between emitted photons and other particles can be observed
and used to evaluate the properties of the object. A fundamental
component of EMR is it's wavelength, defined as the measured space
between two consecutive peaks of a wave (IMAGE). The wavelength of a
photon determines if and how it will interact with the particles around
it, as well as defines the amount of energy it has. Measuring the
differences in photonic energy before and after interacting with another
particle is the core of any remote sensing utilizing EMR.

Perhaps the simplest path to understanding how the properties of photons
(i.e. energy, wavelength) are used for remote sensing purposes is
through the use of an equation. Albert Einstein explained the energy of
a photon as the product of its wave frequency (the number of waves that
pass a specific point over a certain amount of time) and Planck's
constant (Equation \@ref(eq:energy-freq))

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E = hf 
(\#eq:energy-freq)
\end{equation}
```
Where E is the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant (h = 4.14 ×
10^−15^ eV/s) and f is the wave frequency. Clearly, an increase in
frequency results in an increase of energy. This equation may be altered
to include other properties, such as the speed of light and wavelength
(Equation \@ref(eq:energy-wvl)).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E = hc/λ 
(\#eq:energy-wvl)
\end{equation}
```
Where E is the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant, c is the
speed of light (c = 3 x10^8^ m/s) and λ is the wavelength of the
radiation. This equation contains more variables, but incorporates
wavelength and in doing so utilizes an easy to measure (hc always equals
1240 eV/nm) and familiar characteristic. Due to the large range of
wavelengths that photons can exhibit it is necessary to use a specific
style of writing to describe them, called scientific notation.

### Scientific Notation

Expressing extremely large or small numbers presents a challenge to both
efficiency and accessibility that has existed likely since the creation
of mathematics. Scientific notation presents a simple solution to this
problem through simplifying numeric presentation to a value less than 10
that is raised to a particular power. Put simply, the decimal point of a
large or small number is moved to make the smallest, single digit whole
number. The number of places and direction that the decimal point moves
is described by an associated power of 10. Equations \@ref(eq:SI-large)
and \@ref(eq:SI-small) depict how large and small numbers are presented
in scientific notation, respectively.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
1,000,000 = 1.0 X 10^{6} 
(\#eq:SI-large)
\end{equation}
```
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
0.000001 = 1.0 X 10 ^{-6} 
(\#eq:SI-small)
\end{equation}
```
### Electromagnetic Spectrum

Now that you have an understanding of how the properties of photons can
be measured and how to write them, we can begin to explore the
electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The EMS is the continuum along within
photons are located based on their properties (Figure
\@ref(fig:11-EMS)). We have discussed both wavelength and frequency,
which are inversely related and commonly used to describe EMR. Figure 2
also depicts a thermometer laying sideways, which demonstrates that as
an object's temperature increases, the wavelength of the photons emitted
decreases. This follows Equation \@ref(eq:energy-wvl), which
demonstrates that photons with shorter wavelengths have higher energy. A
practical example of this would be that the majority of photons emitted
from the sun (5,788 K) are around 0.5 x 10^-6^ nm, while the majority of
photons emitted from the human body (\~310 K) are around 10^-4^.

Visualizing the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) in Figure 2 certainly
enables a wonderful comprehension of many concepts relating to photons.
Perhaps more astounding, however, is the truth of how the faculty of
human vision has incorporated these properties. The portion of the EMS
that humans can see is between 400 nm and 750 nm, which correlates with
the most common wavelengths emitted from the sun. Perhaps it should not
be surprising, but of all the possible wavelengths emitted in our
environment, human eyes have evolved to maximize solar photon emission.

### Radiation Types

Since it is possible for photon energy to vary widely across the EMS, it
can be useful to group photons based on their wavelength. Generally,
there are seven accepted categories. it is important to note that these
categories have gradual boundaries, rather than sharp dividing lines. In
order of increasing wavelength they are: radio, microwave, infrared,
visible, ultraviolet, X ray and Gamma ray. We will detail each of these
seven groups in Table 1 [@zwinkels2015]. If you wish a visual tour of
the EMS you can explore [this

## Physical laws of radiation

With a solid grasp of why EMR is useful for remote sensing science and
how EMR is categorized along the EMS, we can begin to apply this core
knowledge with ideas and applications related to practical use. As with
radiation, there are a plethora of terms used to describe the
fundamental concepts that make remote sensing science possible. Some of
the most common terms have been included below. They are organized into
three categories: Radiation Basics, Foundations of Measurement and
Methods of Normalization.

**Radiation Basics**

The use of radiation to quantify properties of an object is inherently
linked with relatively complex theories of physics. To minimize both
confusion and workload, we will highlight a select number of key
concepts that support the use of the EMS for remote sensing (Figure
WORKFLOW\_). The first concepts to become familiar with are radiant
energy and radiant flux

Radiant energy is essentially the energy carried by photons, which is
measured in Joules (J). Recall that the amount photon energy defines
what wavelength (Equation \@ref(eq:energy-wvl). Radiant flux, which is
interchangeable with radiant power, is the amount of radiant energy that
is emitted, reflected, transmitted or absorbed by an object per unit
time. Radiant flux considers energy at all wavelengths and is often
measured per second, making it's SI Watts (W), which is simply Joules
per second (J/s) . Spectral flux is an associate of radiant flux and
simply reports the amount of energy per wavelength (W/nm) or (W/Hz).
Combined, these two terms allow us to describe the interaction with
electromagnetic radiation and it's environment; radiant energy interacts
with an object, which results in radiant flux.

Now that you are familiar radiant energy and flux, we can discuss
irradiance. Irradiance refers to the amount of radiant energy that
contacts a 1 m^2^ area each second (W m^-2^). This includes all
electromagnetic energy that contacts our 1 m^2^ surface, which could be
a combination of radiation from the sun, a halogen light bulb overhead
and your computer screen. Another important concept is solar irradiance,
which strictly refers to the amount of solar radiation interacting with
our 1 m^2^ area. Solar irradiance is very important in many remote
sensing applications as it determines which photons an optical sensor
*could* record in naturally illuminated environments. An associate of
irradiance is radiance, which refers the the amount of radiant flux is a
specific direction. The direction in question is often called the "solid
angle" and makes radiance a directional quantity. You could imagine
holding a DLSR camera 90 ^0^ above a flat leaf so that the only item
visible to the shutter is the leaf. The camera would capture the
radiance reflected from the leafs surface and the solid angle would be
90^0^. Essentially, irradiance is used to measure the radiant energy
that contacts a 1 m^2^ area, while radiance measures the radiant flux of
an object from a specific angle.

So far we have discussed radiant energy and flux as basic concepts
interacting with a single object (leaf) or 1 m^2^ surface. In reality,
radiant energy from the sun begins interacting with objects as soon as
it enters earth's atmosphere. The process by which radiation is
reflected by other particles is called scattering. Scattering occurs
throughout the atmosphere and is generally separated into three
categories: Rayleigh, Mie and Non-selective.

The three categories of atmospheric scattering are defined by the
energy's wavelength and the size of the interacting particle. When the
wavelength of incoming radiation is larger than the particles (gases and
water vapor) with which it interacts, Rayleigh scattering occurs.
Phenomenon related to Rayleigh scattering include Earth's sky appearing
blue. When the wavelength of incoming radiation is similar to that of
the particles with which it interacts Mie scattering occurs. The size of
particles generally considered to similar is between 0.1 - 10 times that
of the wavelength. Smoke and dust are common causes of Mie scattering. A
third type of scattering occurs when the particles involved are lager
than the wavelength of the incoming radiation. This is called
non-selective scattering and results in the uniform scattering of light
regardless of the wavelength. Examples of non-selective scattering are
clouds and fog.

The combination of these three scattering types leads to drastic
differences between the amount of solar irradiance at the top of the
atmosphere and at sea level (Figure \_\_). There are also a variety of
wavelengths at which ozone, oxygen, water and carbon dioxide absorb
incoming radiation, precluding entire sections of the EMS from reaching
the surface. Overall, only a small portion of energy emitted from the
sun reaches the Earth's surface. Most energy is absorbed or scattered by
particles in the Earth's atmosphere

    fig_cap <- paste("Solar radiation spectrum from 250 - 2500 nm. Irradiance measurements at the top of the atmosphere (yellow) and sea level (red) are depicted. The grey line represents the theoretical curve of a 5250 degree C blackbody spectrum. Created by Robert A. Rohde for Global
Warming Arts (CC BY-SA 3.0), 2007.")
    knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "11-solar-radiation.png"))
```

The process of scattering is also affected by the properties with which
it interacts. The angle at which EMR interacts with a surface, as well
as the surface material, determine the properties of reflection. A
reflector is described based on the properties of EMR that are reflected
from it and range from specular to diffuse. Specular reflectance occurs
when EMR is reflected in a single direction and can also be called
ansiotropic reflectance. A mirror is an example of a specular reflector.
A diffuse, or Lambertian, reflector reflects EMR in all directions
equally and can also be called an isotropic reflector. An example of a
surface that reflects EMR isotropically is paper.

Although specular and diffuse are measured on an spectrum four general
classifications for reflectors are accepted: perfect specular,
near-perfect specular, near-perfect diffuse and perfect diffuse. diffuse
surfaces tend to be the most useful for remote sensing as they scatter
light in all directions. This is useful because sensors can only view a
surface from a single angle and can also be moving. Attempting to
determine the angle at which EMR is reflected would make many projects
unfeasible, especially those covering large areas.

This is not to say that diffuse reflectors are perfect, however, as some
issues remain related to the angle of incidence and the position of the
sensor. For example, both back scattering and forward scattering affect
the amount of radiation that reaches a sensor, depending on where the
sensor is located. If a sensor is observing an object at the same angle
as the incident radiation, the majority of reflected EMR will be from
backscatter, or EMR that is scattered back towards its source. If the
object being observed is perfectly specular, no EMR reflected off the
object would be captured by the sensor. If the object is a diffuse or
near-perfect diffuse reflector, then there is less of a concern with
regards to capturing reflected EMR.

**Foundations of Measurement**

Now that we have discussed radiant energy and the concepts underpinning
its interactions with other objects, we can begin to explore the
measurements that our sensors record. One of the most important concepts
to understand is that of the spectral signature, or spectra. A spectral
signature refers to the amount of electromagnetic energy recorded across
a defined section of the EMS. A nice example of a spectral signature is
Figure \_\_, which presents the sun's radiation between 250 - 2500 nm in
the units of solar irradiance (W/m^2^/nm). Similar graphs are common
throughout remote sensing and can employ different units of measure.

The base measurements taken to generate spectral signatures is of an
objects radiance. Acquiring radiance across a defined section of the EMS
can be conducted by a variety of sensors and at different spatial
scales, highlighting the practical advantages of evaluating surfaces
using EMR. To fully capture and compare the objects being measured,
however, it is often necessary to normalize radiance. The need for
normalization stems mainly from the aforementioned issues of atmospheric
effects, source and sensor location and sensor calibration. As with any
normalization, the first step is to identify our minimum and maximum
values.

There are two common reference measurements used to determine minimum
and maximum radiance: dark and white reference. A dark reference is
often taken by measuring the amount of energy recorded by a sensor when
the input device is ignored. In theory, this would be the internal
darkness of the machine and is considered to be the minimum radiance
value in practice. The maximum radiance value is slight more challenging
to determine as it requires a perfectly diffuse, flat white surface. A
commonly used material is Spectralon, which has almost 100% reflectance
between 400 - 1500 nm and greater than 95% reflectance over the entire
optical region of the EMS (250 - 2500 nm). With both minimum and maximum
values defined, it becomes possible to calculate normalized spectral
values for a variety of properties across changing conditions.

**Methods of Normalization**

Upon calibrating an instrument to both 100% and 0% reflectance, it is
possible to determine three normalized measurements of EMR: reflectance,
transmittance and absorption. Each of these measurements provides useful
information for understanding the interactions between EMR and the
environment.

Reflectance refers EMR that has interacted with and effectively bounced
back. It has emerged as a popular method of evaluating a variety of
environmental properties, including land use change, plant health and
plant diversity [@asner2011]. Another popular normalized measure of the
interaction between photons and a surface is transmittance. A photon
that is transmitted has passed through the surface with which it
interacted and provides insight regarding how much energy can reach
other surfaces below. In a forestry context, this information can be
particularly useful when determining the amount of radiation that
reaches below the upper canopy (cite LAI, etc.). Absorptance is a third,
related measurement that refers to the amount of energy absorbed by the
cells within a surface and is roughly equal to the amount of energy not
captured as reflectance or transmittance (Equation
\@ref(eq:absorptance)).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
Absorptance = 1 - Reflectance - Transmittance 
(\#eq:absorptance)
\end{equation}
```
Although relatively straight forward, these definitions allow us to
start exploring a variety of remote sensing applications. In fact, most
optical remote sensing techniques employ at least one of reflectance,
transmittance and absorptance to examine the world. Before moving on to
the next section, please review the work flow below highlighting what we
have learned so far. In our next steps we will move from theory to
application and begin to explore the factors that define the quality,
and therefore capability, of remotely sensed data.

:::

## The Four Resolutions

One of the first considerations any user must make regarding remotely
sensed data is its quality. For most scientific research, good quality
data needs to contain information that is relevant to the scale and time
period of the study. It would be challenging, for example, to evaluate
the changes in vegetation cover in Vancouver, B.C. from 2010 - 2020 by
looking at a single image of Calgary, Alberta from 1995. Although this
example may seem extreme, it highlights the need for data collectors and
users to communicate about where, when and what is included in a
dataset. Enter the Four Resolutions.

### Spatial Resolution

Although each resolution is important, spatial resolution holds a key
position when determine the usefulness of a dataset as it determines the
scale at which information is collected. When a sensor collects
information it does so in a single area. That area could be the size of
a single tree or a single city, but all the EMR measured by the sensor
will be an average of that area. Generally, this area is referred to as
a picture element, or pixel. A pixel is the smallest addressable digital
element and basic unit of remotely sensed data. When multiple pixels are
collected in adjacent areas, perhaps using an instrument with multiple
sensors on it, the output is called an image. In short, an image is a
collection of pixels, which represent mean values of the area they
represent. Spatial resolution, then, is the ground area represented by a
pixel.

There are a variety of factors that affect spatial resolution, or the
size of a pixel. One important factor is the sensor's field of view
(FOV). A field of view refers to the observable area of a sensor and is
defined by two things: the angle of the FOV and the sensors distance
from it's target. Changes in these two factors result in an increase or
decrease in the amount of area captured by a senor and therefore a
change in pixel size. Pixels that cover larger areas are considered to
have lower spatial resolution, while a relatively smaller pixel is
considered high resolution. When a sensor is in motion, collecting
multiple pixels across space and time, the term instantaneous field of
view (IFOV) is used to describe the FOV at the time each pixel was
collected. We will learn more about the challenges of collecting data
over space and time in Chapters 12 and 15.

To determine if a certain spatial resolution is useful, then it would
need to be detailed enough to include the features of interest, but
large enough to be stored and processed in a reasonable manner. It must
also cover the entire study area, which can vary significantly depending
on the research objectives. Each of these considerations will direct the
data user to a specific sensor. From here, the user can begin to
consider the remaining three resolutions.

### Temporal Resolution

Much like spatial resolutions deals with the space that a sensor
observes, temporal resolution refers to the time interval between
successive observations of a given space. Temporal resolution can span
seconds or years and is requirement when investigating change. Much like
spatial resolution, an acceptable temporal resolution is defined
inherently by the nature of the study. For example, a study monitoring
the annual urban expansion of Vancouver, B.C. would have a temporal
resolution of 1 year.

### Spectral Resolution

Earlier in this chapter the concepts and theories surrounding EMR were
presented. These theories related directly to the concept of spectral
resolution, which refers to the number and dimension of specific EMR
wavelengths that a remote sensing instrument can measure. Due to the
large range of the EMS and properties of EMR, the term spectral
resolution is often used to refer to any single component of its
definition. In scientific literature, it is not uncommon to find
"spectral resolution" referring to:

-   the number of spectral bands (discrete regions of the EMS) that are
    sensed as a single unit.

-   the location of these units, or groups of bands, along the EMS.

-   the number of individual bands within each unit. Also called
    bandwidth.

Each of these components plays a role is describing the spectral
resolution of a pixel and enables users to identify appropriate sensors
for their application. It is also important to consider the laws
associated with the energy of EMR. Recall that shorter wavelengths have
more energy, which makes it easier to detect. The implications of this
is that longer wavelengths require larger bandwidths for the sensor to
observe them. An easy visualization of this concept involves selecting
two wavelengths along the EMS. If we select the first wavelength at 0.4
and the second wavelength at 0.8, we can use Equation
\@ref(eq:energy-wvl) to demonstrate that the first wavelength has twice
as much energy as the second. This is an important theory to note as the
consequences of a decrease in energy is a decrease in spatial resolution
(a larger number of bands need to be combined to collect enough
information).

A common method for visualizing the spectral resolution of a sensor is
to place each band along the EMS (NASA Figure). This allows users to
determine which sensor best captures the information they are interested
in studying. For some applications, such as land use, it is acceptable
to use sensors with relatively wide bands collecting information in a
small number of strategic locations along the EMS. For other
applications, spectral information may need to be more detailed and
capture information using thin, adjacent bands spanning a large region
of the EMS. These specifications will be discussed in greater detail in
Chapter 12, so for now we'll focus on how spectral information can be
useful.

The collection of spectral data across more than one band allows the
creation of a spectral curve, or spectral signature. Spectral signature
are the cornerstone of many remote sensing applications and highlight
many properties of the surface from which they were collected. The
creation of a spectral signature is quite simple and can be depicted in
two dimensions (FIGURE). Essentially, the observed value of each band is
connected to the observed value of each adjacent band in 2D space. When
all bands are connected, a spectral signature is born. As we will see in
a later case study, spectral signatures can provide a plethora of
relevant information relating to the composition of an object.

SPECTRAL SIGNATURE FIGURE

### Radiometric Resolution

In short, radiometric resolution is the quantifaction of a sensors
ability to detect differences in energy. Photons enter a sensor through
a filter that only permits specific wavelengths.The energy of the photon
is recorded as a digital number (DN) and the digital number is assigned
to a pixel.

A simple visualization of radiometric resolution would be to think of
three colors: red, green and blue (Figure Cambridge in color). A sensor
detecting energy in the ranges of these three wavelengths would contain
three separate detectors. Each detector is specialized to record energy
in a single, unique range, say red (\~700 nm). The amount of energy that
is recorded while observing an area is stored in a pixel as a DN, with
the lowest DN number representing zero energy in this wavelength range
and the highest DN representing maximum energy.

The radiometric resolution of a detector, then, is the number of
segments present between zero and maximum DN values. These segments are
usually referred to as bits and can be mathematically represented as an
exponent of 2 (Equation \@ref(eq:bits)). The number of bits in that a
detector can resolve may also be called the *color depth* of the image.
**Figure** clearly presents the increase in detail provided by
additional bits, but recall that increasing any resolution generally
increases storage and processing time. As such, it is important to
select an appropriate radiometric resolution based on the needs of your
study.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
8 bits = 2^8 = 256 levels

\end{equation}

## Key Applications

So far in this chapter we have covered the theories and concepts that
justify the use of EMR for remote sensing. With these fundamentals in
mind, we can begin discussing some common applications of remote
sensing. For the purposes of this book, we will focus on studies related
to environmental management.

The use of optical remote sensing (400 - 2500 nm) to analyze the
environment has become popular over the past half century. Sensor
development, improved deployability and decreasing costs have enabled
many researchers to use selected sections of the EMS to monitor
everything from global land use change to the chlorophyll content of a
single leaf.

Large-scale research projects focused at national or international
levels have perhaps benefit the most from improved sensor deployment.
Since 1972, a variety of satellites have been launched with the sole
purpose of observing the Earth. Landsat is NASA suite of satellites
designed specifically for this purpose. By the end of 2021, a total of
nine Landsat missions will have been launched, eight of which have
successfully reached orbit and provided imagery in at least 5 broad
spectral bands at 30 m\^2 spatial resolution. This information has been
used to monitor land cover change, ecosystem services and a variety of
other environmentally relevant metrics. EXAMPLE 1. EXAMPLE 2. The case
study at the end of this section highlights a particularly novel
approach to optical remote sensing that has become a popular methodology
to evaluate plant health and biodiversity @asner2009 @asner2016

As far as Canada's contributions to remote sensing sensors rank,
RADARsat is among the most important. This satellite was launched in
1995 and has grown to a constellation of three space-borne synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) sensors that feature variable resolution. As an
active sensor, RADARsat produces and measures EMR with wavelengths
between 7.5 - 15 cm and is capable of penetrating clouds and smoke. It's
active nature also enables RADARsat to record observations at night.
Chapter 12 will discuss radar in more detail.

Another active remote sensing technique that has become popular is light
detection and ranging (LiDAR), which can also be called airborne laser
scanning (ALS). LiDAR is particularly useful in evaluating structural
components of the environment, such as forest canopies and elevation.
More details regarding the theories and applications of LIDAR will be
presented in Chapter 15.

In 2009 Asner and Martin presented the concept of airborne spectranomics
@asner2009. Their idea was based on the fact that plant leaf tissues
contain a variety of different components that are associated with
underlying environmental conditions and that variations in these
components can be captured by observing their effects on electromagnetic
radiation (Figure \@ref(fig:11-traits)). They proposed a method that
linked leaf functional traits, both structural and chemical, to leaf
reflectance between 400 - 2500 nm using partial least squares regression
(PLSR) modeling. They demonstrated that these models could accurately
predict the leaf traits in questions and proved that this methodology
could be scaled to the canopy-level (). Asner and Martin also showed
that plant species could be accurately grouped based on the similarities
of their spectral signatures (Figure \@ref(fig:11-specdiv)). Combined,
these concepts enabled the accurate detection of functional and
biological diversity across both the Andes and Amazon region of South
America.

## Summary

In this chapter we have covered a variety of physical theories that
support the use of electromagnetic radiation for the remote analysis of
objects. Although time consuming, and perhaps not as interesting as
exploring successful applications, these ideas provide the fundamental
knowledge needed to employ remote sensing technologies. From sensor
selection to data processing, your ability to perform remote sensing
science will rely almost exclusively on your capacity to comprehend the
relationships between the objects of interest and the physical
properties that comprise them.

In the next chapter you will enter the world of sensors and explore a
vast amount of technologies that collect information remotely. This
journey will include active and passive instruments, as well as examples
of scientific studies that have successfully employed the data they
collect. Much like a carpenter selecting the correct tool for a specific
task, you will need apply your knowledge of the fundamentals to identify
the best sensor for your research.
